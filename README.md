# ⚡️ Hyperlayer

Debug your Ruby apps 10x faster.

> Depending on which research you look at, developers say they tend to spend 25–50% of their time per year on debugging.

## What is Hyperlayer?

An entirely new way to visualise Ruby apps, combining application flow, state and the code itself.

Removes a lot of what we’re having to do manually to debug apps.

It is a paradigm shift in how we engineer software.

Works out of the box, supporting any Ruby based app.

This is just the beginning.
