# ⚡️ Hyperlayer

Debug your Ruby apps 10x faster.

> Depending on which research you look at, developers say they tend to spend 25–50% of their time per year on debugging.

## What is Hyperlayer?

An entirely new way to visualise Ruby apps, combining application flow, state and the code itself.

Removes a lot of what we’re having to do manually to debug apps.

It is a paradigm shift in how we engineer software.

Works out of the box, supporting any Ruby based app.

This is just the beginning.

## Getting setup

### Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'hyperlayer'
```

Hyperlayer adds a few tables so `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

In your `spec_helper.rb` add:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Add this block
  config.around(:each) do |example|
    trace = Hyperlayer::Tracer.setup_trace
    trace.enable

    example.run

    trace.disable
  end

  ...
end
```

Finally mount the UI by adding this to your `routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Hyperlayer::Engine => '/hyperlayer'
```

Note: You must have Redis installed and running locally.

### Using Hyperlayer

Once you have completed the above, running a spec will cause the events to be emitted to Redis.

In order to listen to/process the events, the following must be running:
```ruby
rake hyperlayer:listen
```
You should see events coming in as they are processed. Note: Events aren't stored in Redis, simply streamed through, so the rake task must be running _before_ you run your spec.

Now simply load `http://localhost:3000/hyperlayer`.
