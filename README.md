# ⚡️ Hyperlayer

Debug your Ruby apps 10x faster.

> Depending on which research you look at, developers say they tend to spend 25–50% of their time per year on debugging.

## What is Hyperlayer?

An entirely new way to visualise Ruby apps, combining application flow, state and the code itself.

Removes a lot of what we’re having to do manually to debug apps.

It is a paradigm shift in how we engineer software.

Works out of the box, supporting any Ruby based app.

This is just the beginning.

## Getting setup

### Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile

```
gem 'hyperlayer'
```

A few tables are added to handle Hyperlayer objects so `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

Add in your `spec_helper.rb` please add:

```
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Add this block
  config.around(:each) do |example|
    trace = Hyperlayer::Tracer.setup_trace
    trace.enable

    example.run

    trace.disable
  end

  ...
end
```

Finally mount the UI by adding this to your `routes.rb`:

```
mount Hyperlayer::Engine => '/hyperlayer'
```

### Using the app

To use Hyperlayer run your app locally and then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or wherever you mounted HyperLayer)

Then simply select the process you want to view the spec for! For better instructions I recommend you watch the video - choose one of the "Debugging with Hyperlayer" chapters above!
